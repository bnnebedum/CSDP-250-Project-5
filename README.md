# CSDP 250 Project 5
    This program contains three files:
        1) Header file (BST.h): to store the class definition
        2) C++ file (BST.cpp): to store the definiton of each member class function
        3) C++ file (main.cpp): the place to start this program

# Description:
    This program creates a binary search tree linked list by inserting 40 random natural numbers. 
    The program will first display the tree inorder, prompt the user to delete a value from the tree, 
    then display the updated tree using postorder traversal. 
    It then uses a recursive function to test if the tree is an AVL tree.
